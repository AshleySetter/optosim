# optosim
Matterwave group simulation library.

This is the optosim package developed primarily by [Ashley Setter](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/ajs3g11/) of the [Quantum Nanophysics and Matter Wave Interferometry group](http://phyweb.phys.soton.ac.uk/matterwave/html/index.html) headed up by Prof. Hendrik Ulbricht at Southampton University in the UK.

This library contains some classes and functions to solve the SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation) describing the motion of trapped nanoparticles. This library is dependant on the optoanalysis library, also primarily developed by [Ashley Setter](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/ajs3g11/) which is used for analysing experimental data from leviatated nanoparticle experiments. This allows one to apply the same tools to simualted data as to experimental data in order to validate the experimental results and data processing tools.

Some example usage of this library is shown in [this Jupyter notebook](sim_data_usage_demo.ipynb).

If you use this package in any academic work it would be very appretiated if you could cite it.
